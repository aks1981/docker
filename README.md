# What is Docker?
Docker is a container management service that allows developers to build applications, ship them into containers and run them anywhere.

# The Jargon
Base Image: An OS user space.
Image: A read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization.
Container: A runnable instance of an image.

# Docker Hub
Docker Hub is a registry service on the cloud that allows you to download Docker images that are built by other communities.

You can also upload your own Docker built images to Docker hub. You can use an image from this registry by looking up the library name and adding that to your Docker File.

For Example
To search up a certain Ubuntu Image we Google “docker hub ubuntu” and we get a link to the Ubuntu library.

https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/
